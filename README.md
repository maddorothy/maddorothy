- 👋 Hi, I’m @maddorothy or Dorothy. 
- 👀 I transitioned from customer service to the tech field in 2022 after getting certified in IT Support.
- 🌱 Since then, I've learned a ton and grown into a Technical Support Engineer, a role in which I occasionally contribute and edit code within my company.
- 💞️ Excited to learn more!
